1. Basic Form Workflow (Web + PHP)

    Flow:

        - User fills out an HTML form.
        - Form sends data to a PHP script using method="POST" or method="GET".

    PHP script:

        - Checks the request method.
        - Reads the form data ($_POST or $_GET).
        - Validates it (required fields, formats, etc.).
        - Sanitizes/escapes it before output.
        - Optionally redirects or shows a response page.

    Key terms:

        - Request method: How data is sent (usually GET or POST).
        - Action: The URL the form submits to (action="process.php").
        - Superglobals: Special PHP variables like $_POST, $_GET, $_SERVER that are always available.

2. HTTP Methods: GET vs POST

    GET:

        * Data goes in the URL: page.php?name=Bob&age=18
        * Good for: searches, filters, links you can bookmark.
        * Not good for: passwords, sensitive data, long text.

    POST:

        * Data goes in the request body (hidden from the URL).
        * Good for: login forms, registration, anything that changes data on the server.
        * Often required for security-sensitive actions.

3. Getting Form Data in PHP

    Data from <form method="POST"> → $_POST['fieldName']
    Data from <form method="GET"> → $_GET['fieldName']

    Important ideas:

        - Never trust user input.
        - Assume anything in $_POST / $_GET might be empty, wrong type, or malicious.

    Always validate:

        * Required fields not empty.
        * Correct format (email, numbers, etc.).
        * Reasonable length.

4. Validation (Required Fields & More)

    Types of validation:

        - Presence: Is it there?
        - Format: Email, numbers, allowed characters. (Use htmlspecialchars())
        - Range: length: Too long, too short?

6. Common Web Security Concepts (Beginner Level)
    
    XSS – Cross-Site Scripting

        - Attacker injects HTML/JS (like <script>alert('xss')</script>) into inputs.
        - If output is not escaped, the browser runs it as code.
        
        Protection:

        * Escape output with htmlspecialchars().

        Don’t inject raw user input directly into HTML, JS, or attributes.

    CSRF – Cross-Site Request Forgery (for later)

        - Attacker tricks a logged-in user’s browser into sending a form to your site.
        - Beginner note: just know that POST alone is not enough protection.

        Protection: 
        
        * CSRF tokens.
