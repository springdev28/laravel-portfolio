PHP

Introduction to PHP

    PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a widely-used, open-source server-side scripting language designed specifically for web development. It allows developers to create dynamic and interactive websites by embedding logic directly into HTML.

What is PHP?

    PHP is a programming language that runs on the server. When a user accesses a PHP page through their browser, the server processes the PHP code and sends back the resulting HTML. This makes PHP suitable for tasks like:

    * Processing form data

    * Managing user sessions

    * Interacting with databases

    * Generating page content dynamically

Why Use PHP?

    - Simple syntax, especially for those with basic programming or HTML experience
    - Integrates well with HTML and databases like MySQL
    - Supported by almost all web servers and hosting providers
    - Powers many major platforms, such as WordPress and Laravel
    - Large community with extensive documentation and learning resources
