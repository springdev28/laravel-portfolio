PHP Superglobals

What are Superglobals?

    - Superglobals are built-in variables in PHP.
    - Accessible anywhere in the script (functions, classes, files).
    - Start with an underscore and a dollar sign (e.g., $_POST).
    - Used to handle form data, sessions, server info, etc.

Common Superglobals

    $_GET

        * Stores form data sent via URL query string (method="GET").
        * Data is visible in the browser's address bar.
        * Best for search/filter actions or non-sensitive data.

        Example:
        -----
        // URL: example.com/index.php?name=John
        $name = $_GET['name'];

    $_POST

        * Stores form data sent via HTTP POST method.
        * Data is not visible in the URL.
        * Used for sensitive or large form data (e.g., passwords, messages).

        Example:
        -----
        // In form handler:
        $email = $_POST['email'];

    $_REQUEST

        * Contains combined data from $_GET, $_POST, and $_COOKIE.
        * Not recommended for sensitive logic — use $_GET or $_POST directly for clarity.

    $_SERVER

        * Contains information about the server and execution environment.
        * Useful for debugging and routing.

        Common keys:
        -----
        $_SERVER['PHP_SELF']   // Current script path
        $_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'] // Hostname
        $_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] // GET or POST

    $_SESSION
    
        * Used to store data across multiple page requests.
        * Requires calling session_start() at the beginning of the script.

        Example:
        -----
        session_start();
        $_SESSION['username'] = 'Bahar Yüksel';

    $_COOKIE

        * Used to store small amounts of data on the user's browser.
        * Sent back to the server with every request.

        Example:
        -----
        setcookie("user", "John", time() + 3600);
        echo $_COOKIE["user"];

    $_FILES

        * Handles file uploads from a form.
        * Contains file name, type, size, temp location, and errors.

        Example:
        -----
        $_FILES['image']['name'];
        $_FILES['image']['tmp_name'];

    $_ENV

        * Stores environment variables (often set in .env files or server config).
        
        Example:
        -----
        echo $_ENV['APP_ENV'];

    $_GLOBALS

        * Accesses global variables from anywhere in the script.
        * Not often used in modern PHP development.

        Example:
        -----
        $GLOBALS['myVar'];
