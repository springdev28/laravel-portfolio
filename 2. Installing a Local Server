XAMPP Installation and Setup Tutorial for macOS

1. What is XAMPP?

    XAMPP is a free, all-in-one package that includes:

    - Apache (web server)
    - MySQL/MariaDB (database)
    - PHP (the programming language)
    - phpMyAdmin (database management via browser)

    You’ll use it to run and test PHP scripts on your Mac before deploying them to a live server.

2. Download XAMPP

    - Open your web browser and go to: https://www.apachefriends.org
    - Click “XAMPP for OS X” to download the latest version.
    - Wait for the .dmg file to finish downloading (it’s usually around 150–200 MB).

3. Install XAMPP

    - Once the download completes, double-click the .dmg file.
    - Drag the XAMPP folder into your Applications folder.
    - After copying finishes, go to: Finder → Applications → XAMPP

    Double-click XAMPP.app (or manager-osx.app).

    Note: You might see a warning saying
    “XAMPP can’t be opened because the developer cannot be verified.”
    This is normal, follow the steps below to fix it.

4. Allow XAMPP to Open (macOS Security Fix)

    - Click the Apple logo → System Settings (or System Preferences on older macOS versions).
    - Go to Privacy & Security → scroll down.

    - You’ll see a message:
    “XAMPP was blocked from use because it is not from an identified developer.”
    - Click Open Anyway.
    - When prompted again, click Open.

    Now XAMPP should launch successfully.

5. Start the Web Server

    Once XAMPP opens, you’ll see several tabs.
    Click Manage Servers at the top.

    You’ll see two main options:

    * Apache Web Server — runs your PHP code.

    *  MySQL Database — used for storing data (not needed right now).

    To start:

    - Select Apache Web Server.
    - Click Start on the right side.
    - If the status changes to Running, the web server is active.
