# BTK Akademi – PHP Course Overview

BTK Akademi offers free, certified online courses to help learners build a strong foundation in PHP, making it ideal for aspiring web developers and Laravel beginners. 

I followed this course until the end, but didn't do all the practices. At the start, the lessons were understandable and the intructor was clear in his teaching. However, as the course went on, I noticed a shift in phase, as more tools (like Bootstrap) were added into the mix with little to no introduction. 

In the end, if you're a Turkish citizen, and have experince using frameworks such as Bootstrap, I recommend you give the course a try.
